Defining the Criteria for Switching:

1) Performance -> response time
So we need a threshold number 1st
2) System Health -> Network Issue check, availabilty, stability [Future]

func healthCheckHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Simulate health check logic
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    w.Write([]byte("Provider is healthy"))
}

3) Quality - Accuracy (Error rate) 
So need Error rate + user Feedback

Implementing the Switching Logic:

1) Continuously collect and analyze metrics from providers. So monitoring some metrics
2) Decison Making : 
3) Switching Mechanism: wihtout disruptions

Handling Errors and Recovery:

Error Detection: Identify errors in real-time.
Fallback Mechanism: Switch to a backup provider or retry the current provider.[setProvider]


Identify when it a Provider starts performing poorly and there should be capability to switch
